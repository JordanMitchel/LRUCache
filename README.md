# LRUCache

A Cache with the ability,to add items via a unique key.
You can set the capacity within the constructor of the main class LRUCache.
Based on that limit, if you set it to 5 and you add a 6th item, then the first item added items will be evicted. 
If you call the add Item the 6th time the return object will have variables to see the key and value associated with the evicted item.
